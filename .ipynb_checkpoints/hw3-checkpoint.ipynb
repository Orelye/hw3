    "5. Make sure that the plots and output are rendered properly in your submitted file. If the .ipynb file is too big and doesn't render on Gradescope, also upload a pdf or html in addition to the .ipynb so that the TAs can view your submission on Gradescope.\n",

Use your own judgment in such cases and justify your choices, if necessary._\n",

Usually `.describe()` or `.info()` methods would give you information on missing values. But here, they won't pick \"?\" as missing values because they are encoded as strings instead of an actual NaN in Python. So let's replace them with `np.nan` before we carry out EDA. If you do not do it, you'll encounter an error later on when you try to pass this data to a classifier. "

    "Typically, data isn't readily formatted for direct input into machine learning models. It's crucial for a machine learning practitioner to examine each column and determine an effective method for encoding its information. Let's determine the types of features we have and come up with suitable encoding strategies for them. "
